### Strange stickers

This customer appears normal at first glance, but they will be very conspicuous when viewed on security camera footage, which will reveal their true form. Under the camera's view, you will see that this customer's appearance is very strange, or rather, like a skeleton. Please close the windows immediately and do not provide them with any service.

### Black Holes 

The customer stumbles towards you, looking as if they've just been in a fight, and you immediately notice something is wrong with them. You can sense something is off about their back, and checking the security footage, you'll see strange black holes covering their back. Close the windows and absolutely do not serve them.

![Black Holes anomaly - strange black holes visible on customer's back on camera](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126173258234.webp)

### Nightvision Missing

This customer's abnormality is quite difficult to spot. You look at him and everything seems normal, even in the surveillance footage, until you switch to night vision mode. Then, the customer completely disappears. Close the windows, do not serve him; he is not a normal human being.

![Nightvision Missing anomaly - customer appears normal on regular camera](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126173647029.webp)

![Nightvision Missing anomaly - customer completely disappears in night vision mode](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126173712639.webp)

### Body Double

There was a person who looked completely normal in person, but when reviewing the security footage, a doppelganger was seen standing next to them. This is not normal. Close the windows, and whatever you do, don't give her shawarma.

![Body Double anomaly - customer looks normal in person](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126173754835.webp)

![Body Double anomaly - doppelganger appears beside customer on security camera](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126173822359.webp)

### Out Back Body Double

This anomaly is similar to the "Body Double" anomaly, but the difference is that the double appears in the rear camera's view. Switching to the second camera, you will see the double standing behind the kiosk.

![Out Back Body Double anomaly - customer appears normal from front](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174314367.webp)

![Out Back Body Double anomaly - double appears in rear camera view](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174344879.webp)

### Screamer

This is the most terrifying anomaly; you need to watch out for the jumpscare. You should lower the volume or mute your sound in advance to protect your eardrums! Like many of the monsters in Scary Shawarma Kiosk: the ANOMALY, this customer appears normal at first glance. But when you check the security footage, the camera briefly shows static, and then you'll be startled—this anomaly will suddenly scream right in front of you.![Screamer anomaly - customer appears normal at first](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126173911651.webp)

![Screamer anomaly - terrifying jumpscare face on camera](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126173945311.webp)

### Monster on his back

This unusual situation might seem normal at first glance. But after reviewing the security footage, you'll see a strange creature clinging to the customer's back. Upon seeing this, immediately close the window and refuse to serve the customer.

![Monster on his back anomaly - customer looks normal in person](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174040249.webp)

![Monster on his back anomaly - strange creature clinging to customer's back on camera](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174106310.webp)

### Night Vision Dancer

The "Night Vision Dancer" anomaly initially appears as a regular customer, but when you switch to the security camera's night vision mode, it begins to dance strangely. Close the window immediately and do not serve this customer; it is not normal.

![Night Vision Dancer anomaly - customer appears normal](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174132143.webp)

![Night Vision Dancer anomaly - customer dancing strangely in night vision mode](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174158675.webp)

### Rambling Old Man

An old man approaches the kiosk, muttering some nonsensical things. In *Scary Shawarma Kiosk: the ANOMALY*, this monster is different from the others; you need to be careful. Close the window and make this strange man leave.

![Rambling Old Man anomaly - old man muttering nonsensical things at kiosk](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174235812.webp)

### Hacker

This is a rather interesting anomaly. It will approach your self-service terminal, directly address you by your username, and then start taunting you, claiming it can hack into your computer and cut off your internet connection. Don't waste time, just deny it service.

![Hacker anomaly - hacker approaching the kiosk](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174712718.webp)

![Hacker anomaly - hacker threatening to hack your computer](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174747658.webp)

### Santa Claus

This isn't the real Santa Claus. Don't entertain this imposter. CCTV footage shows that there's something alive struggling in the sack he's carrying.

![Santa Claus anomaly - fake Santa approaching kiosk](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126175330519.webp)

![Santa Claus anomaly - something alive struggling in Santa's sack on camera](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126175419895.webp)

### White Eyes Lady

Observation reveals that her eyes are white with no pupils, which is not typical of a normal human being.

![White Eyes Lady anomaly - woman with completely white eyes](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126175113081.webp)

![White Eyes Lady anomaly - close-up showing no pupils](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126175135159.webp)

### twin girls

These twin girls look very strange; their heads are constantly twisting backward. They're also saying things like, "We share hunger," like some kind of conjoined monster. In short, do not serve them.

![Twin Girls anomaly - twin girls with heads twisting backward](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174511230.webp)

### Headless man

A customer without a head walks towards you and says he can't feel his head anymore.  The situation couldn't be any clearer. So, absolutely do not serve him.![Headless Man anomaly - customer without a head at kiosk window](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127114938091.webp)

### Chopped Head

Even without night vision goggles, the customer's abnormality was immediately obvious. His lips were torn open, or rather, it looked like his head had been severed from his body at the mouth.  When he spoke, his head kept twisting uncontrollably backward. So, don't hesitate, just close the window.

![Chopped Head anomaly - customer with torn lips and head twisting backward](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127120332130.webp)

### Strange Man

The customer was tilting his head back, staring straight up and to the side. Okay, that's not a reason to refuse to make him a shawarma. But if you start making the shawarma, and then, accompanied by a terrifying sound effect, he suddenly collapses in front of the window, don't hesitate—close the window immediately.

![Strange Man anomaly - customer with head tilted back staring upward](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127123448669.webp)

### The Thief of Faces

The customer said the face mask wasn't suitable, it was always itchy. Observing the customer at this point, you'd see he was scratching himself through a human skin mask. Therefore, close the windows and don't serve him.

![The Thief of Faces anomaly - customer scratching through human skin mask](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127123605481.webp)

![The Thief of Faces anomaly - close-up of face mask being scratched](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127123715795.webp)

### Opposite-sex voice

This phenomenon of "abnormal voice in the opposite sex" attempts to blend in with the normal population, but it overlooks a crucial detail: they are using the voice of the opposite sex. If you see an adult man speaking with a little girl's voice, or vice versa, close your windows.

Note that this customer is a male, but his voice sounds like a young girl's, and his posture is also very feminine.

![Opposite-sex voice anomaly - male customer speaking with girl's voice](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126174843208.webp)

Note that this customer is a woman, but she speaks with a man's voice. Also, her arms and legs appear to be covered in abrasions. Do not serve her. You might also notice that her collarbone protrudes at an odd angle.

![Opposite-sex voice anomaly - female customer speaking with man's voice](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126175206122.webp)

### Zombie

First, the lights flicker eerily, accompanied by terrifying sound effects (you need to watch out for this jumpscare), and then a huge figure suddenly appears in front of you. It looks very much like a zombie, so don't hesitate to refuse to let it in. This angry zombie will knock over the trash can and also damage the outdoor power supply. At this point, the player needs to go outside and repair the trash can and the outdoor power supply. There is a specific order to follow: you need to upright the trash can first before you can repair the power supply.

![Zombie anomaly - huge zombie appearing with flickering lights](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127115241979.webp)

### Evict Note

This customer says he's from the police department, and he orders two shawarmas and a drink. He will ask the player for their name. He will give the player a notebook and ask them to write their name in it.

- If you write your name in the notebook, a cutscene will play. After the cutscene, the man will burst into laughter and say you only have 20 seconds left.

- Of course, you also have another option: refuse to serve him.

![Evict Note anomaly - notebook asking for player's name](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127120204989.webp)

### Deer

A deer appeared in the middle of the road. The deer slowly stood up, its eyes emitting an eerie red glow. It stood motionless in front of the window. This situation is too strange; don't try to make shawarma out of this deer, close the windows.

![Deer anomaly - deer standing in the road](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127122931117.webp)

- If you don't open the envelope, the strange man will leave, and you can continue working.
- If you open the envelope, you will immediately reach the third ending of the game. If you want to experience all the endings of the game, or want to unlock all the achievements, perhaps you can try this.

### Michael Myers

Michael Myers is indeed terrifying, but he might just be an ordinary person in a costume. His money is real, so just give him a shawarma and let him go. If you don't serve him, he'll get angry, burst into your shop, and kill you.

![Michael Myers - customer wearing horror movie mask](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126175823990.webp)

### Boxing enthusiast

This customer seems to be a boxing enthusiast.  Besides being a bit restless, there's nothing unusual about him. So, let's get his horse ready and send him on his way.

### drunken man

This drunk man was very strange and completely penniless. He swore he would come back the next morning to pay.

- If you give him a shawarma, he'll pay you more next time.
- If you don't give him a shawarma, he threatens to pull a knife on you and storm into your shop. However, he doesn't actually have a knife, so it's just a false alarm.

![Drunken Man - penniless drunk customer at kiosk](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126180256294.webp)

![Drunken Man - drunk promising to pay tomorrow](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126180319637.webp)

### Terrifying ringtone

Another woman's phone ringtone was a bloodcurdling scream. This might scare you, but it's just a jumpscare.

### disabled woman

A woman will come to the kiosk and ask you not to cut the shawarma in half because she only has one hand. She's a little unusual, but she's a human being too, so please give her the shawarma. She deserves it.

![Disabled Woman - one-handed woman requesting uncut shawarma](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126180611334.webp)

### boogers man

This customer has a peculiar fetish; he wants you to eat his snot and is offering you money for it. You should serve him, but refuse his request.

### Cat trap

One customer seemed perfectly normal, except for her strange cat. This black and white cat had a marking on its back that resembled a face. The woman claimed that anyone who looked directly at that face would die. It was bizarre, but that didn't mean she was a monster.

![Cat Trap - woman with cat that has face-like marking on back](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126181358795.webp)

### Narcissistic shorty

This customer is a short man who is very narcissistic. He ordered a shawarma and a soda. He's just short and very narcissistic; you should serve him.

![Narcissistic Shorty - short narcissistic man at kiosk](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127120922223.webp)

### Throwing shawarma

This customer seems perfectly normal; he orders a shawarma from you. After you prepare the shawarma, he walks straight across the street, throws the shawarma at your window, and then you have to go outside and clean the window.

Okay, this customer's behavior is strange, but he's still a normal human being, so you should still make him the shawarma.

![Throwing Shawarma - customer receiving shawarma](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127121757003.webp)

### fat women doing sports 

A slightly overweight woman kept emphasizing that she trains hard and that you shouldn't be fooled by her physique. She also said that she hadn't eaten for an hour, and this was her reward meal. Haha, maybe she needs to be more disciplined, but right now you need to serve her.

![Fat Women Doing Sports - overweight woman claiming she trains hard](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127124413431.webp)

### Tall Man 

A very tall man politely asked the player for a shawarma. The tall man looked a bit strange, but checking the CCTV footage revealed nothing unusual. Perhaps you should serve him.

![Tall Man - very tall customer politely asking for shawarma](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260127121424026.webp)

### Narrator

The narrator isn't necessarily a customer; it's an invisible voice that will begin narrating your actions. Don't panic, just remember the rules. This is actually a test, but as long as you continuously check the security footage, identify any unusual situations, and provide proper customer service, everything will be fine.

### Meat on the grill

In Scary Shawarma Kiosk, besides having to fend off various paranormal phenomena, even your own meat will turn against you. If the meat on the grill starts pulsating or whispering, immediately turn off the grill (the switch is on the wall to the right of the meat). This sign is easy to miss, but the most obvious sign is when the lights around the meat start turning red.

### Floating figures

During your shift, you might encounter a situation where a sudden fog rolls in, and you can see figures floating in the air. This can be unsettling, but simply close the blinds and wait a moment. They will eventually disappear.

![Floating Figures event - fog rolling in with figures floating in air](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126181515560.webp)

### examine

The store's rules explain this situation. Around 2 AM, a self-driving car will appear, and the lights inside the information booth will turn red. Please leave the information booth.

- Remember, do not look back until the lights return to normal. You can only safely return to the information booth after the lights have returned to normal.
- If you look back at this time, you will trigger the game's fourth ending. If you want to achieve all the achievements or experience the game's multiple endings, you can try this.

![Examine event - 2 AM inspection with red lights in booth](/Scary-Shawarma-Kiosk/image-20260126181851601.webp)

### groans

If you start hearing loud groaning sounds, accompanied by flickering lights, a red tint covering the room, and liquid dripping from the walls, try not to panic; it will all eventually disappear.

### TV Event

Accompanied by eerie sound effects, the lights in the room began to flicker. Strange content appeared on the television screen, seemingly a hand pointing at you and laughing. At this point, you can choose to turn off the television, and everything will return to normal.

But don't worry, you don't need to do anything; this is just a jump scare in the game.

Of course, you can try to keep closing the roller shutter, but it will get stuck. You'll need to try many times, but eventually, when he gets close enough, you can successfully close it.

### peeping tom at the window

In *Scary Shawarma Kiosk: the ANOMALY*,This is one of the most terrifying events you might encounter during your shift. Sometime during the night, the lights might start flickering, and a terrifying figure will appear on the street. Close the blinds and then open them again, and you'll find it has moved closer. Repeat this action until the figure is right outside your window. Close the blinds again, and it should disappear completely.

### Observer

The "Observer" is a strange entity that you'll encounter in multiple locations during your shift. This naked, humanoid creature will appear on the grill, on top of the refrigerator, on the ceiling, behind the trash can, under the counter, and even through the window. Until the very last encounter, it will suddenly appear in front of you in a jumpscare fashion. Staring directly at it will make it disappear.

## All Endings Guide

When you start your shift at Scary Shawarma Kiosk: the ANOMALY, your fate is not yet sealed. Each shift has five possible endings, and this guide lists all five endings to help you better understand the possible outcomes.

Remember, every choice you make in the game can affect the ending. You'll need to make judgments about which customers to serve, which ones to refuse service to, and how to handle unexpected events. Fortunately, this guide will help you understand these possibilities in advance.

| Ending Name | Unlock Conditions | Description |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| [**Ending 1: Perfect**](#first-ending-the-perfect-ending) | **Zero mistakes** during entire shift | Perfect completion |
| [**Ending 2: Unstable**](#second-ending-an-unstable-ending) | **Fewer than 5 mistakes** | Standard completion |
| [**Ending 3: Silent**](#third-ending-the-silent-end) | **Open** the envelope from Smiling Man | Transported to alternate dimension and devoured |
| [**Ending 4: Erased**](#fourth-ending-the-erased-ending) | **Look back** at booth during 2 AM inspection | Transported to conveyor belt and fall into meat grinder |
| [**Ending 5: Neutralized**](#fifth-ending-neutralization-ending) | **5 or more mistakes** | Killed by Inspector emerging from floor |

### First ending, the perfect ending.

To achieve the perfect ending in Scary Shawarma Kiosk: the ANOMALY, you must make zero mistakes during your shift. This means you must strictly follow the rules and correctly identify every anomaly you encounter. This might sound simple, but in reality, you will encounter a large number of anomalies to identify throughout your shift, which is not an easy task, as everyone makes mistakes. However, it's not impossible; once you master all the rules of the game, you can successfully complete your shift and unlock the perfect ending.

### Second ending, an unstable ending.

The "Unstable Ending" is the second-best ending and one of the most common, as making one or two mistakes is quite common. However, you need to make fewer than five mistakes to unlock this ending. If you miss one or two anomalies, refuse to serve a genuine customer, or miss a certain event, this ending will be triggered at the end of your shift. You must make **fewer than five** mistakes, as more than five mistakes will unlock a different ending.

### Third ending: The silent end.

Do you remember this smiling man? He looks rather creepy, doesn't he? During our shift, we chose to serve him and offered him a shawarma. Then, this smiling man gave us a note. If you open the note at this point, it will trigger the third ending of the game.

You will be instantly transported to a bizarre and eerie alternate dimension. The sky is a deep green, and many blurry shapes float above. You will also pass by several gigantic and unsettling human body parts. After walking for a sufficient amount of time, a pair of massive jaws will suddenly snap shut, devouring you, and you will die, unlocking the "Silent Ending."

### Fourth ending: The erased ending.

"The Erased Ending" is another ending that requires breaking an important rule to unlock. This rule requires you not to look back at the shawarma stand during the inspection. The inspection event happens every day around 2 AM, without fail.

Around 2 AM, when the vehicle drives in and the edges of the screen turn red, you should immediately run to the back of the parking space and stay there until the lights return to normal. During the inspection, you shouldn't be aware of anything happening in the parking space.

If you choose to look back, you will be teleported to another world where you become incredibly small (or everything around you becomes incredibly large), and you'll find yourself moving down a conveyor belt. Just before you fall into a meat grinder, you will have a chance to look up and see a giant invisible creature wearing a suit and a hat, with bright lights for eyes, thus unlocking "The Erased Ending."

### Fifth ending: Neutralization ending

The last unlockable ending is the "Employee Neutralization" ending, which requires you to make five mistakes during your shift to unlock. If you make a mistake, such as being attacked by the meat, refusing a human customer, or serving an abnormal creature, a large piece of meat will appear between the refrigerator and the meat pile. **That's the Inspector.**

Each time you make a mistake, the Inspector will crawl out of the floor a little more, until his entire body is above ground and inside the kiosk. Once he's fully above ground, you're doomed. He will kill you if you get close to him, likely scaring you in the process, and unlocking the "Neutral Ending."

The best way to avoid this is to make sure you verify every customer's identity through the security cameras and check the footage from all angles. Keeping a close eye on your meat is also crucial. It's not always obvious when it will attack, and it might be too late before you realize it!
